# Project-2-HIGH-SCHOOL-TRANSCRIPT-READER

## PROJECT LEVEL 2 (SOME CODING REQUIRED)
## HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPT READER

## PROBLEM:

### Background:

A high school student’s transcript is one of the many items a university uses for its admissions criteria. Having this information in our app is needed for many purposes:

•	To provide better college recommendations
•	To further personalize your admissions predictor calculation for each college
•	To surface other students similar to you and the colleges they are looking at

### Challenges:

-	Need a faster and easier way to read the transcript information from high school students
-	The input format of transcripts is not standard.
-	The transcript’s contents are also different among the high schools. Below is an example of a transcript.

## DELIVERABLE: 
The transcript will be provided as an image or as a pdf and we need a way to ‘read’ the text from the file and save it in some sort of data structure (an array, a json blob, etc.). Data results should be organized, by semester/year, subject and grade. Some possible avenues would be:


•	Use an existing library that already reads text like python’s tesseract
•	Use machine learning to create a model that recognizes the text and dumps it on a data structure
